`My name is Mikhail Zhigulin.` 

I passionate to code in Swift. I consider myself as a self-educated Indie Swift developer, iOS/macOS mostly.</br>
Look at my `Open Source` projects. See how it's done in a way I choose, my personal workflow and preferences.</br>

In my spare time I totally in `J.R.R. Tolkien` Middle-earth.
My approbation apps [iOS](https://github.com/perseusrealdeal/TheOneRing) and [macOS](https://github.com/perseusrealdeal/Arkenstone) are all designed in Middle-earth theme.

Another my love is riding a bike. I have a red GT bike for more than 15 years.
